# CHORDINATOR ðŸŽ¹

This project is a musical chord/note generator made with the `React + TypeScript + Vite` template, using the `Web Audio API`.

The design was inspired by the **Suzuki Omnichord** keyboard.

You can generate simple chord patterns (maj, min, 7) by hitting one button, or more complex chords using differents combinations (maj7, min7, add9, dim).
